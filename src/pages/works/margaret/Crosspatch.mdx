This work is based on Lucy Boston's popular pattern **The Patchwork the Crosses**.

The block consists of hexagons. But not the regular hexagons normally used in patchwork. A regular hexagon has six sides of equal length and all the angles are 120°.
The hexagons used in this block have equal length sides but one opposite pair of corners have a right angle (90°) and the other four corners are 135°.

The fabric used are all liberty lawn, many of which had been donated by friends.

  Lucy Bostons design has a large border around the *interesting* part of the block. The
  central part has 24 hexagon compared with 24 hexagon plus 20 squares in the border. This
  was a bit dauting especial as the main colour would be balck.

  After some experimenting we realised that by removing the diamonds between the blocks
  and altering the corner stones more focus could be given to *interesting* part of the
  block. In this revised design, there 6 standard hexagon plus 4 smaller truncated hexagon
  in the border plus 4 slightly less hexagon in the corner stones. The net result is a
  reduction in the number of patch in the border from 44 to 14 per block.

In the traditional block the sides of the nexagons and squares are 1". In the revised block 1¼" has been used to increase the area by over 50% and thus giving more scope when fussy cutting the fabrics.
