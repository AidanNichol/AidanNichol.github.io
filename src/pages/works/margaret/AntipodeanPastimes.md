**Antipodean Pastime** is a memory quilt on several levels.

Trips to New Zealand to visit our daughter prompted me to begin the deliberately time consuming, interesting but light to pack kaleidoscoped hexagons. Over the years I've collected ways of dividing a hexagon. I'd hoarded highly patterned fabric from the seventies onwards. Naturally enough I bought fabric with New Zealand themes to add to the memories.

Foolishly I left the black triangles until nearly the end. These were completed on our 2010 stay in Auckland. Later that year enforced inactivity recovering from surgery and radiotherapy gave me time to sew all the elements together. I deliberately sewed the dingy areas first and left the bright areas until last.

I decided to seek a professional help if Antipodean Pastimes was ever to be finished. Ferret quilted simple semicircles, not to detract from the complex patterns.
