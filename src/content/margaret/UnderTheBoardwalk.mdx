The Shipley Museum in Gateshead used have a bi-annual international quilt show.

I was invited to make a piece for the show in 2004. I took the marble floors in St.Marks Basilica as my inspiration.
I had long admired these floors and they were a must see item on the trip I took with my daughter to Venice.

Unfortunately, we hit the time of year when a lot of Venice was flooded and so we had to walk around on boardwalks to keep our feet dry.
Obviously, this detracted from our view of the floors but did give me the title for the work.

While visiting my daughter in Nottingham, I discovered Mr. Sharma's stall in Nottingham market which had a vast array of fabrics for making saris.
I was able to purchase all silks that I required in the appropriate shades.
