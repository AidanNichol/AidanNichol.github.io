In 2009, _the Quilters Guide of the British Isles_ asked all the regions and specialist groups to make banners
to represent themselves. The banners were to be used at the AGM and other event to create a presence for each part of the organisation.

This created a bit of a problem for BQSG (_the British Quilt Study Group_) because we are a research group rather than a making group and our members are spread across the whole country.

I met this challenge in various ways.

- Our interest is in the social aspects of quilting both tradition and modern so the banner is made up of 6"
  blocks using both range of techniques from the traditional _English Piecing over Papers_ through to _computerized machine quilting_
  and _computer printing images onto fabric_.
- The latter enabled me to include the two publications for the results of our members research _Quilt Studies_ and _Culcita_.
- The blocks themselves include references to the 1718 coverlet, various traditional blocks, and Welsh quilting patterns.
