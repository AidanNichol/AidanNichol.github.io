This is based on the cast concrete relief sculpture created by Henry and Joyce Collins and installed
on the side of the BHS (now Primark) building in 1974.

This work focuses on the facets that are associated with the river Tyne.

The main features are

<TextImage left='SongTyne/BridgesOriginal.jpg' right='Bridges.svg'>
  In the top right are the bridges on the river in central Newcastle. The sculpture
  features the Tyne , the Highlevel and the Swing bridges. I've added the Millenniums foot
  bridge, and the Queen Elizabeth metro bridge.

<TextImage left='SongTyne/TyneGod1.jpg' right='SongTyne/TyneGod2.jpg'>
  The top left features the God of the Tyne. The image in the sculpture did not translate
  well into quilting so the 'original' was used instead. This became popular when used as
  the frontis piece of a book, *The History of Newcastle-upon-Tyne* 1790. This image was
  derived from one of the sculpted heads on Somerset House in London, depicting the seven
  river of England

  cost of arms.
